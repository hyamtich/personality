2019-06-14 21:13:25,"b'@sacwriter I have always loved Myers-Briggs, but Enneagram is winning me over because it highlights how you function in stress and when thriving. There is movement as opposed to a static combination of letters. Sounds like we are very similar, I am an ENFJ and a 3w2'",b'ChurchTherapist',http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1033441323725017095/5hjLpnZX_normal.jpg,1841

2019-06-10 16:16:47,"b""@asteroidlilith I think you're definitely right about INFJs being able to walk away once it's been made. What type are you? And it's ok, a lot of people mistake the J/P thing because the tests can be misleading. I am an ENFJ who will often test as a P in dichotomy tests.""",b'MeghanLeVota',http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1133759007556943872/Gk0gE_DK_normal.jpg,1038
